## A golden globe atop a tower of eights.

This was the first one we discovered thanks to Airiel, he lead us all the way to the golden globe since he recognised it from the prompt in the scavenger hunt. Thank you Airiel, very cool!

## The disembodied hands of a great ape.

Dunno how I didn't recognise this, I literally took pictures of it for my first class. Thankfully the people in my group were able to figure it out as they saw it. Thank god they were paying attention...

## A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.

Not even sure if this even is the roots that were in the scavenger sheet, but we literally couldn't find anything else that was related to that prompt. A bit of a reach, but no harm in trying...

## A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.

On our way to the library to find books containing digital media, we ended up finding the wide net referenced in the scavenger hunt. I wonder how long it took to make?

## A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many.

To help find the books, we actually asked one of the people working in the library to help us. They were really nice, and even went as far as to show us where the books were at. It's not cheating, right?

## A study space fit for a Sith Lord.

Thought that this would be impossible to find, but somehow Airiel actually managed to find it using the preview images we've got from the task. The library helper also showed us directions to this place! It's a very cool looking area, I think I'd be more distracted with its aesthetic if I were to study there...

## An explosive cup of coffee.

We asked one of the guys on the second floor working in a coffee shop if they knew what this was. Somehow, they actually figured it out and told us it was the coffee shop down a level called Bang!

## A door for the condemned.

Now this was particularly tricky, but thanks to me being the only one in the group knowing about Old Melbourne Gaol and Ned Kelly, I actually found it somehow! Once I read the sign using the word 'condemned,' I immediately knew this was it. Hopefully the people in my group weren't freaked out by the fact that RMIT is next to the Gaol, though...

## A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.

This was actually one of the first ones we saw, but since it was under maintenance we didn't get a picture. Being the last one we found, we decided to get drinks instead of looking for the basement, since that was impossible for us all. Airiel got scammed though, he paid for a drink that never even came out...
