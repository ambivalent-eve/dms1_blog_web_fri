## The 30s Video

For some reason, some of the videos were zoomed in. Had to click set to frame size to set all of them to be recorded at the same resolution.

Video is playing very jarringly. Not sure how to fix it? It's not synced very well.

Tried fixing it later on at the end, but it didn't work. I ended up using this to my advantage anyway by transforming the video into a VHS aesthetic.

Had to adjust the brightness and contrast, emboss, colour emboss, etc in order to make the clips all seem older.

Also adjusted the sound design of the video clips to give off more of a feeling of nostalgia by making the audio sound crispier and outdated through the FFT filter and distortion

Because there was little to no audio from my clip and Alyssa's, I had to add my own sound effects for the ambience. For the sound of the machine running and the birds chipping, I used lowpass at 20,000 hz cutoff to make them sound far away or to make them quieter. For the machine, I adjusted the audio so that it's louder in the left ear than the right because that's where the machine is.

In the end, I decided that Jamie's shot of the city shouldn't have the same VHS aesthetic applied to it but rather should stand out on it's own as a 'modern shot.' This way, it creates juxtaposition between the moving, city shot and the still, VHS shots of places at home.

For the transitions, I added them so that the cuts in between the shots weren't as sudden. Furthermore, I decided to add sound effects of static to give off the idea that the video is breaking apart and 'reverting to the past.' It's also because the transitions just felt very strange without some audio with it.

I also made sure that the audio was cut up and lowered/raised depending on how much static there was by going through them frame by frame. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the direction I wanted to go for this video was the transition between an adult life and a childhood, the present vs the past. As someone starting university for the first time, going to city alone by myself felt very lonely at first. Thus, I decided to try and emulate some of these feelings into the video through usages of sound editing, video editing and etc. For my clip and Alyssa's, I've added ambience sound to them for two reasons: one was to fill the silence so that the video didn't feel empty but to give them both a 'home' like atmosphere. Quiet, mundane sounds such as the ceiling fan, the clock, the birds chipping in the morning, the machine running - it was a different type of loneliness compared to the city. Essentially, in the city I felt a nervous and overwhelming kind of loneliness whereas at home there is comfort in solitude. Two different types of loneliness between one nerve-racking and one comforting was exactly what I wanted to depict in the video. I also had the city clip cut in half so that it would flow better with the two clips, as having the city clip play out and then the other two wouldn't feel as impacting.

Aside from the juxtaposition of solitude, there is also the theme of missing home. By having the city clip split in two, the individual in the POV of the video is meant to be remembering their home whilst in the city, as the elements and principles of the video are to depict that these homely videos are taken in the past, hence their VHS-esque effect. As for why I chose this theme of missing home, I thought it was something everyone, especially uni students, could relate to. Whether it be foreigners who moved away from their country to enrol in Australia or people like me who live an hour or two away from the city, it was a theme that was very easy to sympathise with. It's also the first idea that came into my head when I saw the clips, I just wasn't sure how to implement it at first.

Ultimately, the video is meant to symbolise the difference in solitude and the idea of missing home. As for what I could've done better, I would've liked to fix the glitchy aspect of Jamie's first clip or improve on the VHS aesthetic to make it look clearer... but perhaps the white, foggy look served a better look for nostalgia? Either way, I could've also improved on my pace on editing, there were some aspects where I took far too long such as having to look for where the effects tab were, or the audio tabs were.
