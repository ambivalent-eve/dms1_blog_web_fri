## The 30s Video

For some reason, some of the videos were zoomed in. Had to click set to frame size to set all of them to be recorded at the same resolution.

Video is playing very jarringly. Not sure how to fix it? It's not synced very well.

Tried fixing it later on at the end, but it didn't work. I ended up using this to my advantage anyway by transforming the video into a VHS aesthetic.

Had to adjust the brightness and contrast, emboss, colour emboss, etc in order to make the clips all seem older.

Because there was little to no audio from my clip and Alyssa's, I added my own sound effects for the video. I've added many others, but realised they weren't royalty-free, or that I literally couldn't find out whether or not they were royalty free. Thus I decided to just go with the radio static sound effect I got from Youtube Studios.

In the end, I decided that Jamie's shot of the city shouldn't have the same VHS aesthetic applied to it but rather should stand out on it's own as a 'modern shot.' This way, it creates juxtaposition between the moving, city shot and the still, VHS shots of places at home. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the direction I wanted to go for this video was the transition between an adult life and a childhood, the present vs the past. As someone starting university for the first time, going to city alone by myself felt very lonely at first to the point where I missed the comfort of my home, which I attempted to depict here.

By having the city clip split in two, the individual in the POV of the video is meant to be remembering their home whilst in the city, as the elements and principles of the video are to depict that these homely videos are taken in the past, hence their VHS-esque effect. As for why I chose this theme of missing home, I thought it was something everyone, especially uni students, could relate to. Whether it be foreigners who moved away from their country to enrol in Australia or people like me who live an hour or two away from the city, it was a theme that was very easy to sympathise with. It's also the first idea that came into my head when I saw the clips, I just wasn't sure how to implement it at first. 

Ultimately, the video is meant to symbolise the the idea of missing home. As for what I could've done better, I would've liked to fix the glitchy aspect of Jamie's first clip.

# Classroom Activity of Drawing Storyboard from Film

## Concepts

# First Draft of Storyboard

![alt text](/w02s1/storyboard-image.png)

Initially, I was going to be featured much more heavily in the video and my representation of the stress I felt towards RMIT was to be visualised differently. As shown in the first shot, it was supposed to feature me in a high angle to present me as smaller and weaker before being presented with a wide shot of RMIT. The wide shot would be used to make the building feel more intimidating before a close up shot of my leg shaking, something I do a lot subconsciously when nervous. However, upon learning that the video is to be taken on a smartphone whilst featuring me as little as possible, I scrapped the whole storyboard in place for another to fit the project.

# Second Page Concept

After the first page, I was going to begin with shots of me at my train station, but upon realising that I had no idea where to take these shots afterwards and how to connect them to me in any meaningful way, so I scrapped them...

## Storyboard

# First Page

Upon realising that my storyboards lacked a narrative that both showed me as a person with my hobbies, interests and feelings towards entering the program for the first time, I had to rethink the whole video from scratch. Initially I was very frustrated and went through hours without being able to come up with an idea... which ironically was what lead to me finding out what I could make my video about. Finally, I came up with a simple plot of an artist trying to paint a self portrait of themselves whilst struggling to find inspiration. I reflected this in the first page of the storyboard where it illustrates me trying to find inspiration. The shot begins with a high angle close up of a blank page, a symbol meant to visualise my struggles towards the program where I face a lot of blocks trying to find inspiration. Next a reaction shot of me comes up where I put on a very confused, blank sort of facial expression to try and figure out what to do. Throughout the first page of the storyboard, the usage of diegetic and non-diegetic sounds are done to manifest my current frustrations and anxiety that I face with the program. In the next shot, there's a montage of me drawing up new concepts, scrapping them and then throwing more and more paper into the bin. As illustrated in the storyboard, the shots of me drawing will have the camera come closer and closer to symbolise that as an artist, I'm getting closer to finding ideas for a self portrait. This is in direct juxtaposition to the shots where I'm scribbling, crumbling and tearing up pieces of paper as the more frustrated I get, the further the camera is - showing that despite how close I'm getting to finding a solution, each attempt in failure is frustrating me more and more. It ends up to a point where in four mini jump-cuts of the bin I'm just throwing a bunch of crumbled up pieces of paper. This entire sequence of rapid-paced editing and cuts is to demonstrate my short temperedness and how quickly I can give up when faced with a giant wall. Next, I use a POV shot where I'm tapping my pen repeatedly on the table before panning up towards the Myki card. Here my character realises that in order to find inspiration, I will have to explore more about myself. With a quick shot of my hand grabbing the myki card, the non-diegetic sound of white noise adruptly ends before cutting to black. The black screen then dissolves into a medium shot of my tablet with an empty canvas as the camera gradually zooms in. Again, the empty white canvas is to present that although I haven't found any ideas yet for a self portrait, I at least now have a foundation to explore upon compared to when I was just sketching ideas on a book.

After the shot of an empty tablet, there is a rapidly paced montage shot of my clothes and accessories before ending with a shot of me putting on a red jacket from behind. All the shots are presented with extreme close ups to emanate a more personal feeling towards them. I put focus on these objects due to my interest in clothing and fashion as they evoke a sense of confidence in me, which I highlight through extreme close ups and shooting them during the day. After, I have a medium shot of a cat tower and a close up of my cat Cinnamon. I use these shots to demonstrate that one, Cinnamon is my cat as shown by the cat tower and her sleeping on my bed and two to highlight the feeling of companionship supported in the next shot, a birds eye view of her collar and my two shoes together. I put attention to this because it represents how I am as a person, often seeking friendship, bonds, etc in others because at the end of the day I'm a very social person. It's also to highlight the impact Cinnamon has made on me as a person, making me be more aware of my responsibilities whilst also demonstrating how much more life she's added. This is especially strengthened by the next few shots of my friends at a dinner table and beach, where it illustrates my social nature and how deeply I value my friends. In the next shot, I've shot a wide shot of the sun as the sun is a symbolism of joy, which is to elucidate how I feel towards my friends and pet as they've brought a lot of happiness to my life. The four next shots are jump cuts that illustrate me using what I've explored previously to make a sketch. Here the pacing is slowed down for each clip more to represent a calmer atmosphere, showing that the character is taking their time more for the artwork rather than rushing it. The first shot is done during the day as a medium shot as it showcases me drawing my cat. The next jump shot is now of me in the same position and computer watching something on my computer instead of drawing like earlier, symbolising my inability to stay focused and instead procrasinate. This shot is also taken during the afternoon to represent time passing. The next shot is now in the evening, where it illustrates me continuing to draw again to find inspiration before...

...getting distracted once again, this time playing a game at night. This jump cut not only focuses on my escapism to procrasination but also my inability to find an idea that's truly landed yet, as at this point my character is still unsatisfied with the drawing, which leads to the next shots where I still continue to explore about myself to illustrate. With this, I use shots of Berwick station and the train to symbolise the loneliness I felt upon entering the program which is represented by the empty dinner table, a shot contrasting to the dinner shot which had all my friends. I'm expressing this detail because university was something that was very intimidating to me at first, having to travel on the train alone for the first time and for so long as well. Despite that, I was able to find comfort in said train rides through reading mangas, which is depicted in the next shot. In these feelings of loneliness, I found escapism in books through a close up shot of mangas and figurines I'm interested in. The next shot demonstrates the point in the story my character was able to find ideas for the story as shown by the stereotypical light-bulb, which is enhanced even further with the next shot of a spider-web. I used this shot of the spider-web because that too was also a symbolism of creativity, serving to become the point my character has overcame their art block with a brand new idea. The shot after is a bunch of sketches all next to each other, having meant to represent my new burst of ideas by focusing on my interests instead of a literal portrayal of me. This is also a contrast to the shots of the blank canvas, as this time the drawings are now all filled out. The next shot shows an orange ball, which is meant to symbolise my perfectionist nature, only being satisfied by a drawing or concept if it's 'perfect,' hence the symbolism of the ball, a perfectly round sphere. This shot will be replaced by a match cut of the headphones, representing my massive interest in music and how much life it brings to any and all situations. This is demonstrated through the next shot of the three primary colours, a red scarf and two blue and yellow squares, as music is comparable to that of colour with the way they both enhance life itself. The next shot is a close-up of white lillies, which are symbolisms of rebirth. In this case, the rebirth is quite literally my motivation and ideas, having to start from scratch multiple times to make a 'self portrait' of myself due to myself being too frustrated or not satisfied with the current work. My next shot is that of my glasses, which originally was going to be a magnifying glass. Here, the glasses represent my dedication to detail within art, which is also highlighted in the next shot as a fire, symbolising my passion for art. Finally, the canvas is shown again, with me now sketching out a drawing before a jump cut appears of the same room, this time the drawing being completed, symbolising that the character in the story is finally satisfied with a 'self-portrait' of himself, deciding to draw his own self-interests to represent himself instead of a literal selfie of how he looks.

## Continuity

Through my work, I aim to establish continuity and discontinuity through the voalitional attention through my video. As established, the story is that of an artist attempting to find inspiration in their work for a self-portrait, which the video highlights through its entirety. Sometimes, discontinuity is shown through jump cuts such as when the character attempts to draw in the middle of the video, but starts to procrasinate out of a lack of inspiration and dedication. 

## Editing

The editing of the video is meant to be more rapid, more fast paced. As a self portrait of myself, it's meant to represent my more energetic, fun and dedicated personalioty. As the main theme however, it's meant to represent the character's eagerness and frustration to try and find something they're satisfied with as a self portrait. Furthermore, the use of mostly still shots along with close up shots is to make the video feel like a personal POV from myself, as I'm examining all these images, visuals, objects and then relating them to me in a way.
