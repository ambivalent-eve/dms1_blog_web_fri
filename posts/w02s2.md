A key moment in this video is towards the end, when the character is working towards completing his artwork before jumping to a shot where it shows the completed work. With this video, both sound design and soundtrack will be used to enhance the emotions and themes of the narrative. In the first shot where the character is still working on his artwork, there is an absence of diegetic sound as the character is fully concentrated on drawing. This is represented by the use of music playing in the background, where the music is upbeat and cheerful and the character is still wearing headphones on. When the scene suddenly cuts to the next of the artwork being finished, the non-diegetic music disappears. Instead, the scene is now left with the sounds of silence and ambience sounds, which is a total contrast to how much music there was previously in the next scene. The choice of removing music and making the scene almost silent is coordinated with the visuals of the room being darker with the morning rays going through the curtains. The use of darkness and quietness is done to represent satisfaction and achievement - feelings that I as an artist feel when I finally finish my work and can happily look at the finished product. 

Overall, the emotional tone of the broader portrait is to be uplifting and hopeful. The beginning of the video illustrates the artist getting frustrated with his work, but as the music starts, the tone shifts dramatically as the artist tries their hardest to get over their art block. This is represented by the editing of the video at the beginning being more and more rapid to generate the feelings of annoyance the artist feels from his art block. As the music starts, the editing is a tad bit slower but still fast paced to show his passion towards art and his more extroverted personality. 

During this moment, the audience is supposed to understand that the two shots represent the stages of the artwork. The first shot obviously being the sketch and the second shot being the final product. Both shots are demonstrated separately both visually and audibly. Visually, the first shot takes place with the artist sketching the drawing at night time before the second shot shows the room in the morning. Audibly, the music still continues to play in the first shot before ending adruptly in the second shot, representing the peace and satisfaction the artist feels from completing his work.

In terms of rhythm, tempo and pace - the second shot will last longer than the first one with a slower pace. This is to contrast the videos original high-paced energy and tempo with a final slow paced shot to emanate a more relaxing atmosphere. This will be produced by uses of a still shot of the canvas as well as ambience sound from the audio such as the fan going off and the birds chirping in the background.
