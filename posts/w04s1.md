## Black Squares Activity

![alt text](/w04s1/blacksquares.png)

During the process, I've experimented through various ways to create images utilising a maximum of four black squares. Although I wasn't used to using Adobe Illustrator at first, I quickly grew used to it after watching and learning various shortcuts. Things such as using shift to alter the size of a square or rotating it to 90 degree angles, using the ctrl, shift and alt for moving the canvas around, using ctrl+0 to reset the canvas to full screen, etc. Other shortcuts that were more convenient to me were Shift+E to use the eraser tool where I erased parts of the squares that overlapped in another white square, C to use the scissor tool to cut out squares outside the template and V to select the squares. These shortcuts have sped up the process dramatically, reducing the amount of time I'm using the mouse.

I've applied elements of design thinking by brainstorming as much as possible. As the activity was focusing more on quantity rather than quality, I've gathered up bundles of ideas and just simply tried illustrating them the best I could without worrying whether or not it was 'good.' Because of that, I was able to brainstorm with as much creative ideas as possible.

## Assignment 2 Prompts

Out of all the prompts for assignment 2, the one to appeal to me the most is dream.

For the prompt, the idea will be to design videogame UI icons on a gaming platform such as Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch, etc. With gaming, the intended audience would be teenagers aged between 13-17. The brief would be to illustrate icons for dream like abilities the character can use in an action video game.
