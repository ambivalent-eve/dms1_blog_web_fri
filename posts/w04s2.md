## Thumbnail Sketching Activity

The most effective one in communication is most likely the forth row with the one on the right. The 90 degree angle of the brush is probably the most recognisable, simplistic and easy of the bunch, as logos are often most efficient when given a design that is easy for people to remember. Furthermore, it also communicates the target audience the logo is for, aka artists.

After brainstorming various concepts about the word dream, I ended up coming up with these nine ideas for the icon design. 

# Nightmare
After taking other popular video games into account with the way their design their ability icons (Overwatch, Valorant, League of Legends, Apex Legends, etc) minimalistic black and white icons that are roughly in the square aspect ratio would work best. With that style and aesthetic in consideration, I'd go with the last one with the skull, as it emphasises the nightmare aspect the best in the most easiest way with the skulls negative connotations.

# Lucid Dreaming
As an 'ultimate' sort of ability, I wanted to originally portray the icon with something flashy, although too much detail would make the icon less memorable. Deciding that the infinity symbol was a bit too simplistic, I decided to go with the one of the person flying upside down with the moon. As the moon is often associated with sleeping and night, I thought it worked best with the person flying upside down. Also, the two forming a ring of sorts still implies a sort of loop with infinite possibilities, so I thought this worked best!

# Desires
As an ability based on reading peoples internal desires, I believed the easiest way to convey this sort of utility was the second one, as it portrays the character reading into others which could be easily implying them to be reading the 'dreams' of others.

# Hallucinations
As a more sinister ability, I wanted to give this a more uncanny icon that just felt somewhat more eldritch. Therefore, I think the first icon of the large eye works best with it, as visual hallucinations are one of the more recognisable and common of the senses.

# Visions
As owls are known for their vision, I believe the first icon would be best to present the icon due to the connotations and symbolism surrounding owls.

# Memories
Memories was an interesting concept to tackle, and probably the one I hard trouble with the most. Although the visual of using the clock to rewind back was cool, it didn't really fit with the theme of memories but more with time. The last one with the book however did stand out to me as reading a persons memories like a book, so I think that might be the best and most interesting option yet.

# Sleeping
Personally, I think the forth choice of clouds is a more unique way of tackling the 'sleeping' icon compared to a person in bed, blowing a bubble out of their noses or just a couple of z's due to the phrase "sleeping on clouds." It implies a comfortable slumber that I believe just fits very well.

# Dreamwalking
A more abstract kind of ability where the character just starts travelling through dreams in some sort of astral plane. I really like the first option for this icon, as meditating is a very recognisable icon for these kind of abilities, and the clouds beside them help freshen up the idea a lot more.

# Dream-blasting
With every action game, there's usually always a projectile for the characters to shoot so I tried to give the same thing here. Unlike many of the ability icons, I don't feel as if this one needs to be restricted in a square aspect ratio, so I believe that the third one of the character holding some sort of dream-conjured up gun fits quite well, although the gun kinda feels out of place, so I might swap out that specific part with just shooting some dream energy or something silly like that.
