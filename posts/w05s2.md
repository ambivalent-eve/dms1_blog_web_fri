## Replacing template with my own icons

![alt text](/w05s2/image.png)

Whilst it worked smoothly for the most part, there were points where for some reason the images weren't displaying correctly. First I tried renaming them all to simple numbers like 01, 02, etc and this worked out for most of them. Despite that, 03 was still bugging out and the first one wasn't changing images when clicked on. For some reason, the fifth icon was working despite not having .png in the code, so I tried that and they all worked? I'm not sure why or how, nor do I know what even went wrong. But if it's fix, that's all that matters to me at least...

## Update
Never mind. They didn't work again. I put .png back into the code and they decide to start working.
