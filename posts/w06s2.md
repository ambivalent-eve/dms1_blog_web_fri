## Finalised Icons

Throughout the time spent on this project, there have been significant and minor changes.

Originally, the plan was to have the icons be based of tarot cards. I figured this would have both an aesthetically pleasing look to the abilities whilst also having a rough connection to the theme of dreams. After all, there is a superstitious belief that dreams can tell the future, and that's also the same purpose as a tarot card. I would've continued with this - but my laptop deleted the files and I had to start anew. Nonetheless, I don't regret the design choices I've made now.

As I started anew, I decided to go with a much simplier design for the ability icons. Looking over various popular games and seeing the shapes, I realise just how common it was to have squares in the UI - but what caught my eye the most was the way Hades by Supergiant handled ability icons. They placed the squares at an angle and had bright, flashy yet stylistic art that were easy to look at. Inspired by the graphic design and simplicity, I've based a lot of my inspiration of them.

As the assignment was a flat design style, I made sure I remained minimalistic in my designs - not just because it was apart of the brief but because in games like these, it's important to have a somewhat simplistic design that captures what the icon was related to. Popular examples include Overwatch, where ability icons were very simple to understand. Ana's sleep dart being a bunch of Z's, Genji's dash being an arrow shaped like a sword to indicate movement, communication was a big part of ability icons. Even in Hades, one could understand the icons as they use different colours for their boons.

Representing the protagonists dream-ability to sense the desires (or dreams) of people, I took inspiration from a recent Daredevil comic I read with Marco Chechetto. With the element of shape, I emphasised the connection of the protagonists ability to sense others by illustrating it to be similar looking to how media depicts echolocation. Granted they aren't the same thing, but the connection can make readers very easily assume that it's some sort of sensing ability. I used dark purple, red and white for this palette so that I can have the rings around the protagonist stand out more. I've added the beeping sound I recorded from a while ago to further relate it to how technological sensing type abilities can feel.

The ability to dreamwalk. To be honest, I just made this one up as I couldn't think of any other synonyms with dreams that I could use, so I just borrowed the dream-skating thing from Scott Pilgrim. Since an ability like this inferred something like fast-travelling/teleportation, I emphasised the silhouette of the main character to be in front of the white border of the square. Not only does this sort of signify that this ability puts the protagonist in some sort of astral plane area by putting them 'out of the physical realm,' but the clouds behind him also infers to dreams. This is because in the 6th image for sleeping, I related the imagery of dreams with clouds. Additionally, I've added stars to the main character to make them seem more otherworldly. I've also used the colour palettes of dark blue, grey skies and yellow to relate to the act of sleeping. I've added a sci-fi ambience like sound effect to further exemplify the outerworldly nature of this ability.

The hallucination abilities. Even though there was a literal icon for nightmare, I wanted to make this one much more creepy. Because of this, I've altered the element of shape for this one and completely changed how this looks so that it would look out of place with the other icons. The scribbly nature, the ink like brushstrokes and the total absence of any colour - it feels like a sore thumb in a way... almost like it doesn't belong, like a hallucination. For this one, I emphasised the shape of eyes and utilised repetition to relate them to hallucinations, as visual hallucinations are probably one of the most common/recognisable. Additionally, the use of repetition just makes it seem much more uncanny. For this sound effect, I put emphasis on the sounds of insects so that the icon can appear much more creepier.

The lucid-dreaming ultimate where the protagonist can form anything from their minds. As an 'ultimate,' I wanted to make this one stand out some more, therefore I utilised the elements of colour by using blue, red and yellow - the primary colours. Being the only icon to have all three primary colours, it puts some emphasis on this icon as being much more important. The use of shape with the infinity symbol was also to imply an infinite amount of possibilities, and the use of perspective on the yellow-energy beam was to demonstrate how much power this ability had. For the sound effect, I added the loud bonk effect to make this ability sound like an ultimate by making it feel strong.

The memories ability. Instead of going with a book like before, I decided to go with a camera instead, as pictures are also related to dreams. Apparently, warm colours like red, orange and yellow helped in making people remember memories, so I utilised that by incorporating them into my design for visiting the past of people. For the sound, I just went with a simple clicking sound like you'd hear from taking a photo on a camera.

The nightmare ability. Unlike the horror-theme I went with on the hallucinations icon, I went with an icon that appeared more threatening than it did horrifying. For the colours, I went with purple, yellow and green because I felt those colours were the ones that are most synonymous for evil. For example, most of Spider-Man's villains sport the purple and green look. I utilised emphasis on the skull in the middle through the purple fire on the bottom of the squares so that the eyes would be drawn towards the skull. As for why a skull specifically, it was the easiest idea I could think of that people could relate to nightmares. For the sound, I used the loud blowing sound to have something more violent and burst-like.

The primary fire. If it's an action game, chances are there's probably an ability that lets you shoot people, so this is what I chose since I ran out of ideas. As the most simplistic of all the abilities, I decided to let the icon visualise that same simplistic nature. As for the arrow, I figured it would be the simplest to showing what a projectile out of a dream-power could look like, as I didn't really know how to illustrate energy blasts in Adobe Illustrator. I utilised the principle of unity by making the icon symmeterical, so that even though it's very basic - it's still enough to pop out and attract one's attention. I used the sound of glass breaking for the ability since it wasn't an arrow being shot out but energy.

The ability to make people fall to sleep. Like the ability to dreamwalk, I use dark blue, yellow and grey because that was a colour palette I wanted people to infer 'sleeping' with. That way, people can look at this icon and be able to infer the connection. I emphasised the use of clouds because of the phrase 'sleeping on clouds' making it very easy to relate this icon to sleeping. I also used the crescent moon as another symbolism to sleeping. For the sound, I used water since I wanted a more relaxing, drawn out sound.

The ability to see into the future with your dreams, I used owls for this because of their nature as nocturnal animals with good vision. I used a dark blue colour palette here since it's already established that dark blue is correlated to night-time. For the sound, I used an echo-y hoot from the internet since it sounded pretty supernatural... and like an owl.

## Conclusion

Not only that, but since this was icons for a video game, I decided to have the two icons that the main character showed be a recognisable silhouette. I used this by having them rock the long, wavy kinda hair with two glowing lenses so that it was a silhouette that was easily remembered by others. Additionally, most of the icons are somewhat following the three colour rule, which was to have 60% of the icon be predominated by one colour, 30% be filled with the secondary colour and 10% filled with the other colour. This was a principle that made colourful artworks pop out more to the audience. I also utilised the principle of balance and emphasis together by having the focus of all the icons be directly in the middle so that the audiences eyes would be drawn towards them more. 

As for when the icons were pressed, I used a simple glowing yellow border around them since the colour yellow was already so predominant in my designs.

Regarding my thoughts about the project, I enjoyed it, although learning Illustrator was pretty frustrating - but so was getting sick and feeling guilty about the extension.
