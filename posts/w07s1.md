The core concept of what I'm planning to do is an empty horror map. I want to try and emanate the feeling of being isolated but also deeling like you're not alone. I also want to play around with the use of lighting, having most areas being mostly dim and dark to invoke the fear of the dark/unknown whilst pairing it up with sound effects.
