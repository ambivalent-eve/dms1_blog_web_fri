My classmate Alyssa underwent a play testing of the build. During the video, it seems that whilst she was still looking around curiously on what was in the environment, she still had the sense of navigation of where to go. The video went on for about a minute as the amount of content in the playbuild was quite small, but she ended exactly inside the room which was the end point. This meant that the original intentions of the world was fulfilled, having a sense of navigation of where to go and ending at where the player was meant to finish. With this in mind, I've decided to continue working as I normally had been whilst working on the world.
