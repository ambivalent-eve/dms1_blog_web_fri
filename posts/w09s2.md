Theme:

The theme of the build was to symbolise my illness and how its been detrimental not only to my university work but also outside life. I wanted to portray the outside with a more photorealistic aesthetic with flowers, trees and etc whilst contrasting the inside of the house with a more gritty and eerie look instead.
